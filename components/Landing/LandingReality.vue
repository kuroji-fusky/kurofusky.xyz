			<h2>All of this sounds impressive... but here's the catch</h2>
			<p>
				I'm just a broke individual from the Phililppines who works on projects
				entirely on my own; which explains why 90% of my projects aren't
				completely finished.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sure, having a wide range of skillset is impressive and all, but it's
				difficult for most people like me to get to the top whilst facing
				constant sight of obstacles along the way.
			</p>
			<p>
				The sad and honest truth is that I currently don't have a job and just rely on
				YouTube revenue and music streams to keep me financially afloat. It's hard to find a
				target audience who supports your work and it would take a really long
				time.
