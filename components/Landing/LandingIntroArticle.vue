			I'm Kerby Keith Aquino, but I usually go by my alias <b>Kuroji</b> or just
			<b>Kuro</b>. I'm a 21-year-old independent and self-taught individual from
			the Philippinesâ€”I usually work and handle everything on my own just for
			the fun of it; but sometimes, I work on external projects for other
			people!

			Despite currently not having a job, or work experience, or by no means
			expert on the stuff I do whatsoever, I have an aptitude and passion for
			wide range of skills entirely self-taught ranging from writing
			<em>bad</em> code and making overedited videos on YouTube as a hobby!
