    <h2>About Me<span id="gradient-block"></span></h2>
    <p>
      I'm a self-thought developer and somewhat profient in front-end web
      development and because of this; JavaScript is my main language that I have
      consistently work on -- mostly working on Vue.js, a UI framework to build
      my own and other websites, worked a bit of Node.js for bots on Discord and
      other backend magic... I guess lol

    <h3>Videos and filmmaking</h3>
    <p>
      I've been making videos on YouTube for nearly decade with varying in terms
      of quality and my editing style. Previously, I used Sony Vegas to edit on
      my crappy laptop. Now I use Adobe products such as Premiere Pro and After
      Effects for the most of my video work.

      Strangely, my inspiration to begin in filmography and music is through a
      handful of YouTube vloggers in mid-2017, and as a desire to learn
      filmmaking - I recieved my first camera which is a GoPro HERO+LCD, and a
      mirrorless DSLR camera, Canon EOS M50 -- the sole reason I picked this
      specific camera is that it has the ability to shoot videos in 4K lol --
      and naturally, begin to tap into intermediate photography as well!

    <h3>Producing music</h3>
    <p>
      I started to produce music independently in 2017. Initally, making
      hip-hop/rap music, then changed to alternative/indie music in 2020, and
      I've released 2 albums and 2 EPs so far. The DAW I currently use is FL
      Studio, and I'm hopefully making a transition to use Cubase soon, who
      knows? I'm also master my own music and planning to join a record label,
      AWAL, to expand my reach.
