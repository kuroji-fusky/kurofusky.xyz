    q: "Where can I find your ref sheet?",
    a: "You can find my character's ref sheet [here](/character)!"
  },
  { q: "Why are you so cute?", a: "I'm not cute, stop calling me a cutie lol" },
  {
    q: "Are you considering opening a Patreon?",
    a: "Well, *sort of...* I personally think that Patreon might be an overkill as it's focused on one thing and that one thing only. Unless if it's an ambious project that's worth sharing or complete, then yes, I am considering open a Pateron page in the future!\n\nBut for now, I use Ko-fi as a easy and direct way to support my work!"

  {
    q: "Was this website written from scratch?",
    a: "Well, yes! In fact, feel free to look at the source code for [this website](https://github.com/skepfusky/kurofusky.xyz)!"
  },
  {
    q: "What platforms do you host your projects?",
    a: "For websites, I mainly use Vercel - but in some cases, I use Netlify instead.\n\nFor the backend, I've previously used services like Heroku and DigitalOcean but I switched to Railway for its cost effectiveness, especially for all the Heroku migrators."
  },
  {
    q: "What editing software/plugins do you use?",
    a: "I currently use Premiere Pro and After Effects to edit my videos! I also use Adobe Audition for audio fine-tuning as well! Previously, I've edited videos with Sony Vegas, AVS Video Editor, and even Windows Movie Maker before making a final switch to strictly all Adobe products in mid-2017.\n\nFor third-party plugins, I use Red Giant Universe and/or Boris FX Sapphire to give the videos the **enhancement** ðŸ’… it needs."
  },
  {
    q: "How'd you manage to make the subtitles scroll/look differently!?",
    a: "It's a part of Premiere Pro's legacy subtitling feature before it was stripped away following the 2020 releases, which is a bummer.\n\n**Nerd explanation:** basically, there is an option for a CEA-608 (Line 21) and CEA-708, with the first one probably for VHS videos or something and with the latter having more options for colors and positioning."
  },
  {
    q: "Can I remix and/or use your songs in my video?",
    a: "Yes! My entire music catalog isn't covered by any royalties or major music publishers just yet! In fact, I'll be releasing stems as much as I can so *anyone* is free to remix it!"
  },
  {
    q: "Why did you change your name from Skep to Kuroji?",
    a: "It's a long story... I couldn't explain it in full just yet."
