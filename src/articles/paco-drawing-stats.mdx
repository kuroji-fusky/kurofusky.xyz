**Paco Drawing Stats** is a stats website where it parses drawing data from a professional artist
and illustrator, Paco Panda (also known as pandapaco, pacopanda, and probably a million
iterations with his name).

## History

The project began on October 31, 2021 - without any underlying back-end knowledge whatsoever. As
I learn more web technologies, I've rebuilt this project in Vue.js, then I worked with the drawing
data with Python with libraries such as matplotlib, pandas (get it?); then I had to rewrite the
website **again** with Next.js since I'm having problems with Vue.
