**Searchpets!** is a search engine-like app where you query and filter chapters and comics from the [_Housepets!_](https://housepetscomic.com) web comic.

I was an idea that [Max](https://github.com/thatITfox) had until I met him and worked together to build the UI and improving server infrastructure.

The prototype is built in a matter of months, where the comic data is held from on of Max's Linode servers at the time. It contained a Python script that scraps the official Housepets website and dumps it all the data into a single JSON file, acting it as a "database".
