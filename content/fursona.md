Kuroji is a blue and yellow fox-husky hybrid or fusky; and was originally a husky. Wearing thick black glasses and a purple t-shirt with white outlines, and completely pantless!

Mixing with a typical traits both of a fox and a husky, he's a wholesome, outgoing, yet weird personality and he easily gets soft when he's immediately flattered and starts blushing intensely (lol)

### Why a husky? Why a fox?

My fursona was initially a husky until when I'm talking to a friend of mine talking about the usual furry stuff and immediately had an idea to become a fox-husky hybrid; since I equally had a fascination with both foxes and huskies with both their traits after looking at some interesting facts online.

During my childhood, I grew up watching numerous cartoon shows and movies I've grown up, most notably _The Fox And The Hound 2_, the _Balto_ trilogy, Bolt, 101 Dalmatians, and others. (Most of them are Disney movies; unrelated, but I used to watch a lot of Care Bears if you're that old lol) But I think that Bolt and Balto are what influenced it, well sort of... mainly since I like its pure appearance, courageous, and charismatic qualities are what makes me like them the most initially. Including foxes as well!
