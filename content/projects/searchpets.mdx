**Searchpets** is an open source project created by maxthecomputerfox
and skepfusky. The initial idea was to create a website that searches
comics from a furry web comic, _Housepets!_ created by
Rick Griffin - the project started at March 25, 2022.

The project is still in development, but if you want to help us and
improve on this project, feel free to open an issue or pull request!
We're actively working and maintaining this project!

Our reason for creating the project was we wanted to find an easier
way to find the source comic for memes made from comic, so we did!
And as aspiring web developers, we wanted to make something that we
find easy to use and help people along the way with the source code
included.

## Possible inspiration

On September 15, 2021, a user from the Housepets Forums, MasterAbsinthe
[created a way to filter and strip speech bubbles from the 2100+
comics through OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](https://www.housepetscomic.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=5434&p=938783&hilit=search+engine#p938783).

Although updates for it has ceased and we're working on the those
features as it will, of course, take time to implement them.
