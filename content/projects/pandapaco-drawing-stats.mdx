**Paco Drawing Stats** is an open source data visualization project where it parses drawing data from a professional artist
and illustrator, Paco Panda (also known as pandapaco, pacopanda, and probably a million
iterations with his name).

## History

The project began on October 31, 2021 - without any underlying back-end knowledge whatsoever. As
I learn more web technologies, I've rebuilt this project in Vue.js, then I worked with the drawing
data with Python with libraries such as `matplotlib`, `pandas` (get it?); then I had to rewrite the
website **again** with Next.js since I'm having problems with Vue, especially with Vite that caused
the dynamic static asset imports that slowed things down.

## Underlying technologies

This project was initially written in plain HTML, but as I advanced overtime, I rewrote everything in
Vue 3, but as mentioned eariler, I switched from Vue to React, specifically in Next.js since despite
it's popularity, it has most of the libraries written for this framrwork and it's overwhelming
support and documentation.

Because I use Python to scrape and parse drawing data, it would make sense to write the entire back-end
in Python via FastAPI (currently using Flask, FastAPI will be used soon).

## How I gather data
