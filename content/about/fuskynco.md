**Fusky & Co.** is a fictional LLC company name that I usually go under by with my works, such as music, film, and
web projects, through the years it has gone though a lot of names since its inception since 2016.

Taken from my namesake of my alias "Kuroji Fusky", with "fusky" being a fictional breed of fox and husky combined,
it acts as a record label, and a studio.

## History

::ImgFullWidth

I was originally founded as "Sandbox Network"; a MCN (multi-channel network) for specifically for Minecraft creators
but due to other personal priorities (like school, and life in general), it didn't take long to change the name to
"Vel0C17Y" or to just simply "Velocity"; was rebranded as a esports team and a video production company with a
former friend of mine from United Arab Emirates, he re-introduced me to Counter-Strike and the community surrounding
it.
