MY TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE WEBSITE

## some shiz who cares lol
After editing Fandom wikis since June 2020, might as well migrate and create my own portfoilo and dump my own information in here instead. Thanks to my time on Fandom, I have a decent knowledge in CSS and some UI/UX design as well!

My main wiki will still be up online on Fandom though, it will be less updated and all of the recent information will be dumped in here instead.
