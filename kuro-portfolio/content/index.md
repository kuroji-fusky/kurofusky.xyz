## [Under Construction]{style="font-weight: 700"}

The site is currently under construction; because it's no secret writing and maintaining a website
entirely by code is difficult! (and painful too)

It's always in a limbo state where most parts of the site are finished while others are still
either broken or not working properly. And for a long time, I've always wanted to showcase my
works into this website, however, I always change the way I make websites with a different
framework last year, as some of the necessary parts weren't there at the time.

Hopefully I can get it up and running in again this time! Please understand that I'm just a passionate
individual that does all of this as a hobby, it will take ages to complete.
