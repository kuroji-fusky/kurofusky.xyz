An ambious project with a big goal in mind to simplify artists workflow with ease.

## The Problem

Most artists then jump from numerous third-party platforms such as a dedicated website they built from Caard, WordPress, Webflow, etc., manage commission queues and statuses on a kanban-style list app like Trello, and whatever social media the artist prefers to communicate between the client and the artist.

In terms of practicality, an artist's productivity is effectively diminished hopping from platform to platform and there's no way to set things automatically (i.e. when the user fulfills payment, then adds the user to the queue) and have to do things manually unless they have the technical knowhow to write a script that suits their workflow. While it helps, this will require some advanced technical knowledge to pull it effectively.

This is what MyFursona aims to solve. Eliminating all the manual work from managing commission queues, messages from potential commissioners, and more into a single platform that does it all for you!

With the help of passionate developers around the world, we're making this product a reality!

## History

[Jason](https://github.com/VulpoTheDev) initially started the project as _Artistically_ in mid-2021 along with another developer of his. It was shelved after a few months into development as he lacked the motivation to continue the project. That is on March 2022, where he revived the project and was aptly renamed to MyFursona.
