A case study and data analysis project created to parse drawing data from a furry artist and illustrator, [Paco Panda][paco_handle]. With an estimate of over 2,000+ of all the cute floofs he's drawn, I'm on the mission to sort and visualize his artworks in an interesting way.

## History

Wind back to 2021, I was learning web development, entirely self-taught, of course.
