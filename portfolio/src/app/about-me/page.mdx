## Beginnings

Growing up, I was just an ordinary kid doing ordinary stuff - until at around 2006 or 07, I helped my dad building a computer with pre-installed Flash games; and I wasn't the same and had an addiction of getting on the computer almost everyday playing those said games and fidling with Office programs, and system files just out of curiosity and pure boredom.

When my dad bought internet access in 2008, I got exposed to the interwebs, browsing sites like YouTube, Wikipedia, Newgrounds, and Facebook. I also had an interest looking up _really_ niche stuff about Windows and various opening logo animations from films and TVs on YouTube.

## Editing videos

My quest for editing videos started when I was on YouTube watching YouTube Poops from Mario, Zelda CDi clips, and stick figure animations! As I have an itch to start editing videos on my own, however - most video editing software like Sony Vegas and Premiere Pro weren't free, and had to alternate solutions like CyberLink PowerDirector.

I've taken my commitment for editing videos after discovering the 2014 Minecraft scene and SMG4 videos, and I decided to get a "copy" of Sony Vegas. My early content consists of Minecraft videos in late-2015 to mid-2016. And pretty much early on I migrated to Adobe software when I get a decent computer specs in 2017 and still use Premiere Pro to this day!
