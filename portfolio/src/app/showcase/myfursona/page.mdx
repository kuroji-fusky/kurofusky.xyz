**MyFursona** is an art platform that caters to artists to manage and automate their commission workflow and a way for users to store their characters or "fursonas".

MyFursona aims to combine select features from platforms such as FurAffinity, Weasyl, Toyhouse, and Trello; while having a modern UI inspired with the likes of Vercel and Discord.

# The Problem

Most artists then jump from numerous third-party platforms such as a dedicated website they built from Caard, WordPress, Webflow, etc., manage commission queues and statuses on a kanban-style list app like Trello, and whatever social media the artist prefers to communicate between the client and the artist.

In terms of practicality, an artist's productivity is effectively diminished hopping from platform to platform and there's no way to set things automatically (i.e. when the user fulfills payment, then adds the user to the queue) and have to do things manually unless they use a browser extension to execute arbitrary scripts like Violentmonkey and Greasemonkey. while it helps, will require some advanced technical knowledge to pull it effectively.

This is what MyFursona aims to solve. Eliminating all the manual work from managing commission queues, messages from potential commissioners, and more into a single platform that does it all for you.
