## Overview

Believe it or not, it's not my intention to impress him in general.

I'm just a huge fan of his artwork and his unique and adorable art style that I'd want to see how many characters he's drawn since the early to mid-2000s, but he'd for sure find it interesting as it's more of a fun project than a new hobby of mine, learning not only JavaScript but also learning a bit of back-end and basic data management in the process of other projects I do.

## Isn't this taking it too far?

As someone who admires his art, yes... to some extent. Well, sure - it may feel like I watch him on every step, but I only use them for analytical and informational purposes; parsing drawing data on his Twitter profile would be difficult and will require more work.

It's more of a serious yet passion side-project of mine to show various kinds of drawing data from his.

## Techy Stuff

The majority of the heavy work is by scrapping Paco's public profiles from FurAffinity, DeviantArt, InkBunny, DeviantArt, and Tumblr. I didn't bother to scrape his stuff on X/Twitter since it's a lot of work compared to traditional web scraping; and even if I was able to-it's no longer possible because X's API is no longer free.
