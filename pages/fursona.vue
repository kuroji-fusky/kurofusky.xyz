      <h2>Brief Description</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Skep</strong> is a blue and yellow fox-husky hybrid or fusky;
        and was originally a husky. Propped with thick black glasses and wearing
        a purple t-shirt with white outlines, and completely pantless lmao
      </p>
      <p>
        Mixing with a typical traits both of a fox and a husky, he's a
        wholesome, outgoing, yet weird personality and he easily gets soft when
        he's immediately flattered and starts blushing intensely lol
      </p>
      <h2>History and background</h2>
      <p>
        My first attempt at making a fursona was around mid-2019 when I was
        listening to BLACKPINK almost every single day. Because of this - I
        tried making a fursona based on BLACKPINK's color palette on their EP
        <em>Kill This Love</em>.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        But this was immediately scrapped because it turned out horrible due to
        a lack of drawing skills. Yes, I've known about bases that I could color
        from, but I'm still indecisive about how the design will turn out to be
        at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        During lockdown time, when BTS released their studio album
        <em>Map of the Soul: 7 </em> and as a huge ARMY (BTS fan), I've managed
        to listen through the entire album and loved every single track of it! I
        loved it so much that I've used the album cover to make a fursona!

      <p>
        My initial goal was to make the design to be minimal as possible since I
        might have plans to get a fursuit (I know you don't need one but I
        wanted one so bad) for it one day, and it turned out to be just what I
        wanted it to be! It's more of the extended animal version of myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also decided to add glasses to reflect more of my tech-savvy side of
        me. I've gotten design inspiration from other furs like Yaps Fox and
        Charm Husky and adopted them to my fursona to have two sides: one being
        shy and timid, while the other side is me being completely obnoxious as
        a whole lol
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        It had a minor update in July 2021 where I have changed the eyes from
        blue to purple to purple to signify "borahae" or "I purple you"; for
        context: it combines two Korean words: Violet (보라; bora) and 'I love
        you' (사랑해; saranghae) - the word "borahae" has become a staple term
        that unites BTS and ARMY. It was coined by V (Kim Taehyung) during a fan
        meeting in 2016. And as the initial definition by Taehyung himself:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="static-block">
        Purple is the last color of the rainbow colors so it means I will trust
        and love you for a long time.
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        In terms of color psychology, the color purple is also associated with
        individualism, royalty, and ambition. It also can boost imagination and
        creativity, on the other, too much purple can cause moodiness.
      </p>

      <h3>Why the name <em>"Skep"</em>?</h3>
      <p>
        In 2015-2017, the channel name was "FreakingFoxy" and I want to change
        it as I don't want it to be associated with FNAF anymore as the name
        itself is somewhat cringeworthy lol -- until I find a channel called
        "Sethical" and decided to rhyme the word "Sethical" with the word
        "Skeptical" but in all low caps. Then to "Skeptically", and finally
        shortened to simply "Skep" for the sake of simplicity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I brought back the name "skep" for its simplicity and kept the name
        "Kokoro Husky" as a stage/artist name instead. Although, there is a
        popular Minecraft YouTuber with the same name
        <em>(*cough* *cough*, Skeppy)</em> and I would 100% deny any
        associations with him whatsoever.
      </p>
      <h3>Why a husky? Why a fox?</h3>
      <p>
        I was initially a husky until when I'm talking to a friend of mine
        talking about the usual furry stuff and immediately had an idea to
        become a fox-husky hybrid; since I equally had a fascination with both
        foxes and huskies with both their traits after looking at some
        interesting facts online.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my childhood, I grew up watching various shows and movies I've
        grown up, most notably The Fox And The Hound 2, the Balto trilogy, Bolt,
        101 Dalmatians, and others. (Most of them are Disney movies; unrelated,
        but I used to watch a lot of <em>Care Bears</em> if you're that old lol)
        But I think that Bolt and Balto are what influenced it, well sort of...
        mainly since I like its pure appearance, courageous, and charismatic
        qualities are what makes me like them the most initially. Including
        foxes as well!
